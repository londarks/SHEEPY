### :page_with_curl: Summary

I am creating an e-commerce as part of my programming studies, using Python and PHP. I'm excited to expand my knowledge in these languages and create a project for my portfolio.

I chose to use Python and FastAPI because they are powerful technologies for building scalable and fast web applications. The asynchronous architecture of FastAPI allows for superior performance, and the ease of implementation makes development much more efficient.

Additionally, I chose to use PHP to complement my knowledge of web-focused programming languages, as well as to explore the features of its wide range of libraries and frameworks, which will allow me to create an even more robust and complete application.

By using Python and PHP together, I am getting the best of both worlds: the speed and efficiency of Python, and the flexibility and capability of PHP. I hope this project will help me learn even more about these languages and become a more complete and experienced developer.
